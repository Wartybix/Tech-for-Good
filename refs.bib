    abstract = { Motor vehicle collisions are a leading cause of death in North America; they are the single most frequent cause of death among children and young adults and account for one fatality every 10 minutes.1â€“3 During an average year, about 1 person in 50 will be involved in a motor vehicle collision; 1 percent of them will die, 10 percent will be hospitalized, and 25 percent will be temporarily disabled.4,5 Motor vehicle collisions often injure persons who are otherwise in good health. The causes of motor vehicle collisions are complicated, but error on the part of drivers contributes to .\&nbsp;.\&nbsp;. }
