\section{The Problem}

\begin{frame}{What is a pothole?}

\begin{columns}

\column{0.6\linewidth}

How potholes develop:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Cracks in the road develop from wear-and-tear by vehicles.
    \item Water seeps into these cracks.
    \item The water freezes, expanding the cracks --- the pothole is formed.\footnote[frame]{\cite{how-are-potholes-formed}}
\end{enumerate}
Potholes in the road are a challenge and a danger to many drivers and cyclists.

\begin{frame}{Health Risks}

They pose a risk to \alert{health} as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Cars can lose control after driving into them, potentially crashing into other cars, cyclists and pedestrians.
    \item Drivers may attempt to swerve around them when it is unsafe to do so.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For example, driving close to parked cars, abruptly driving into another lane, etc.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Cyclists can crash into them, potentially flipping-over and injuring themselves.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Financial Risks}

    They also pose a \alert{financial} risk due to the cost of vehicle repair.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cars are often damaged after driving over potholes.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item cracks on windscreen
            \item burst tyres
            \item damage to suspension
            \item and moreâ€¦
        \end{itemize}
        \item Drivers called out the RAC to 5,153 breakdowns caused by potholes in Q4 2023 \footcite{car-breakdowns}.
    \end{itemize}
